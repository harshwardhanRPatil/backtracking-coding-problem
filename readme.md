# 📌 Why This Repository Exists

This repo is designed to:

* Provide a **clear, structured roadmap** for cracking Google, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, Uber, and other top companies.
* Maintain a **high-quality DSA repository** with real interview patterns.
* Help revise complex concepts quickly using **clean templates** and **pattern-based solutions**.
* Track progress through categorized problem-solving.
* Build an understanding of **How to Think in interviews**, not just solve problems.

# 🧪 Patterns You MUST MASTER

Google interviewers expect you to solve questions using **patterns**, not brute force.

### 🔥 Sliding Window

Used for substring/subarray optimization.

### 🔥 Two Pointers

Sorting-based problems, pair problems, etc.

### 🔥 Binary Search on Answer

Used for scheduling, partitioning, minimizing/maximizing.

### 🔥 Prefix Sums

Used for subarray problems.

### 🔥 Recursion + Backtracking

Found in all core Google hard problems.

### 🔥 DP by States

dp[index][remaining]
dp[i][j]
dp[mask]
dp[i][prev]

### 🔥 Graph Traversals

BFS, DFS, Topo Sort.

### 🔥 String DP

LCS, Edit Distance, Regex Matching.

# 🎯 How to Use This Repo

1. Learn patterns → Solve problems by pattern.
2. Review time & space complexity for each solution.
3. Use recursion → then convert to memo → then tabulation.
4. Build intuition for feasibility + binary search.
5. Mock interviews + LeetCode + notebook revision.

# 🔥 Final Advice

Google doesn’t hire fastest coders.
They hire people who:

✔ Think in patterns
✔ Explain clearly
✔ Write readable code
✔ Optimize time and space
✔ Debug calmly
✔ Communicate reasoning

This repo helps build EXACTLY those skills.
